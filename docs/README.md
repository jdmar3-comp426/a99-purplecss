# Perfect Type
Our webapp is a dynamic typing game that allows for real-time user input. User's make an account and are able to login into the game. The beauty of perfect type is its zero-tolerence for user error. After a user makes one mistake, they are given a new question rather than being allowed to continue. This molds the player into a more disciplined typer.
